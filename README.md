# Realism-7
The first Realism game. Don't ask why it starts at 7, counting is hard.

This game got a Deluxe release several months after the original, if
you're interested, see the `dx` branch.

If you have any questions or concerns, ask in our [Discord Server][discord].

# What's Here?

This repository doesn't have all that much, just the Riivolution Patch used to play the game.
It's pretty self-explanatory, so I won't talk about it that much.
